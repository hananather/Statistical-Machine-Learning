    \note{
    These notes were created during my review process to aid my own understanding and not written for the purpose of instruction.
    I originally wrote them only for myself, and they may contain typos and errors
    \footnote{Any corrections are greatly appreciated.}.
    \textit{No professor has verified or confirmed the accuracy of these notes.}
    With that said, I've decided to share these notes on the off chance they are helpful to anyone else.}
